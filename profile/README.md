# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Warp Field Guide!

The materials here are built to help you learn more about [Warp Design System](https://github.com/orgs/warp-ds).

## Labs

Lab 1 will introduce you to utility CSS and using 'variants' to accomplish tasks you'd normally use pseudo-classes or media queries for in semantic CSS.

Lab 2 gives a small glimpse into how Warp will use theming and semantic tokens, and then presents a mockup to implement that uses a common pattern in Warp with some accessibility challenges.

Here's [a link](https://warp-ds.github.io/playground?html=DwZwpgxgLglg9gOwAQQDYEMQgLwCIDmATjACZJGkC0EcqIlAzEgEb6UCeYqqcA7pQCYADENwA%2BAFBIkwEjABuKDFjw1UlEAAd0CQSzbNUAVzCCR4qdJmalmHLgC2MXQAsNEQmDAJxc%2BcAB6TUkra1sVR2dKNxAPLx8xP0Dgy0C-EJlMUjBw%2BxBYCABrdiQoOE1KIX1KTWdCs1ExLJIwQOawSUDwaHgEMSA) to a quick puzzle from the talk - see if you can get the sidebar's `sticky` property to work.
